        <main> <h1>Biography</h1> 
        <p id="paragraph">Anne Frank was a young Jewish Girl that lived from 1929-1945. Her parents and older sister moved to the Netherlands from Germany after Adolf Hilter and the Nazis came to power there in 1933 and made life increasingly difficult for Jews. In 1942, Frank and her family went into hiding in a secret apartment behind her father’s business in German-occupied Amsterdam. The Franks were discovered in 1944 and sent to concentration camps; only Anne’s father survived. Anne Frank’s diary of her family’s time in hiding, first published in 1947, has been translated into almost 70 languages and is one of the most widely read accounts of the Holocaust.</p>
        
        <p id="paragraph">Anne Frank stayed back in Germany with her grandmother while her sister Margot and her parents moved to Amsterdam. In February 1934 Anne joined her family. Anne passed the time, in part, by chronicling her observations and feelings in <!-- like to more information about Anne's diary --> <a href="https://www.annefrank.org/en/anne-frank/diary/" target="_blank">a diary</a> she had received for her 13th birthday, a month before her family went into hiding. </p>
        
        <p id="paragraph">Addressing her diary entries to an imaginary friend she called Kitty, Anne Frank wrote about life in hiding, including her impressions of the other inhabitants of <!-- link to more information about where she hid at --> <a href="https://www.annefrank.org/en/" target="_blank">the Secret Annex</a>, her feelings of loneliness and her frustration over the lack of privacy. While she detailed typical teenage issues such as crushes on boys, arguments with her mother and resentments toward her sister, Frank also displayed keen insight and maturity when she wrote about the war, humanity and her own identity. She also penned short stories and essays during her time in hiding.</p>
        
        <p id="paragraph">On August 4, 1944, after 25 months in hiding, Anne Frank and the seven others in the Secret Annex were discovered by the Gestapo. They were sent to Westerbork, a holding camp in the nothern Netherlands. From there, in September 1944, the group was transported to the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination and concentration camp complex in German-occupied Poland. In March 1945, Anne and her sister died of typhus at Bergen-Belsen and their bodies were thrown into a mass grave. </p>
        
        <p id="paragraph">When Anne's father, Otto Frank, returned to Amsterdam following his release from Auschwitz, Miep Gies gave him five notebooks and some 300 loose papers containing Anne’s writings. Gies had recovered the materials from the Secret Annex shortly after the Franks’ arrest by the Nazis and had hidden them in her desk. Otto Frank knew that Anne wanted to become an author or journalist, and had hoped her wartime writings would one day be published.</p>
        
        <p id="paragraph">After his daughter’s writings were returned to him, Otto Frank helped compile them into a manuscript that was published in the Netherlands in 1947 under the title “Het Acheterhuis” (“Rear Annex”). It was eventually published in America in 1952 as “The Diary of a Young Girl.” The book has been labeled a testament to the indestructible nature of the human spirit. It is required reading at schools around the globe and has been adapted for the stage and screen. </p>
